Welcome to to my lab👨‍🔬. This is where I do my tinkering, or contribute to open source software when I have the time. 

I've been working in the tech industry since the dotcom bubble days. Currently I'm leading a team of talented software engineers to deliver full-stack software solutions using agile development methodology for clients.
