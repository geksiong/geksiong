_🚧 Under construction 🚧_

### Hello world! I'm Gek Siong 🧑‍💻

Greetings from sunny Singapore 🇸🇬. This is where I do my tinkering 👷 when I have the time ⏱️.

#### 🤔 About Me

I started coding (in BASIC!) before the Web 🌐 became a thing 😲, and entered the tech industry just when the dotcom burst. I've been an IT consultant, architect, project manager, and I'm now leading a team of mobile & web application developers to implement full-stack software solutions for clients.

I graduated from UC Berkeley with a BS in EECS, and from Stanford with an MS in Computer Science. 

#### 🌱 Interests

* Mobile & Web application development
* Cloud Technologies (Amazon Web Services)
* Continuous Integration & Deployment
* Containers

I also play the classical guitar 🎸 😍 (we need more guitar emojis!) and dabble in other musical instruments.
